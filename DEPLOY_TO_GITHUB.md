# Deploy to GitHub Instructions

Your n8n project is ready to be pushed to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [https://github.com](https://github.com)

2. **Create New Repository**:
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right
   - Select "New repository"
   - Repository name: `n8n-local-setup` (or any name you prefer)
   - Description: `Local N8N automation platform setup with Docker Compose and PostgreSQL`
   - Make sure it's set to **Public**
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Push Your Code**:
   Copy and run these commands in your terminal:
   ```bash
   # Replace 'your-username' with your actual GitHub username
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/n8n-local-setup.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys configured)

```bash
# Replace 'your-username' with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/n8n-local-setup.git
git push -u origin main
```

## What's Included in Your Repository

✅ **docker-compose.yml** - Complete Docker Compose configuration with PostgreSQL  
✅ **.env** - Environment variables template  
✅ **README.md** - Comprehensive documentation  
✅ **.gitignore** - Properly configured to exclude sensitive data  

## Security Note

The `.env` file contains default passwords. Consider:
1. Adding `.env` to `.gitignore` for production use
2. Using GitHub Secrets for sensitive values
3. Documenting environment variables in README instead

## After Pushing

Your repository will be available at:
`https://github.com/your-username/n8n-local-setup`

Others can clone and use your setup with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/n8n-local-setup.git
cd n8n-local-setup
docker compose up -d
```
