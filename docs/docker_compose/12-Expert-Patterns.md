# Expert Patterns in Docker Compose

## Overview
Implement advanced networking and custom solutions for large-scale Compose projects.

## Advanced Networking
- Create custom networks and aliases.
- Example:
```yaml
networks:
  frontend:
  backend:
services:
  web:
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
```

## Service Discovery
- Use aliases for flexible communication.

## Compose with Swarm/Kubernetes
- Transition to orchestration platforms.

## Hands-On Exercise
- Build a multi-network stack with service discovery.

## Best Practices
- Design for scalability and maintainability.

## Self-Assessment
- Can you implement advanced networking?
