# Docker Orchestration: Swarm & Kubernetes

## Overview
Scale and manage containers with orchestration platforms.

## Docker Swarm
- Built-in clustering
- Simple service scaling
- Rolling updates

## Kubernetes
- Industry standard for orchestration
- Advanced scheduling, scaling, and self-healing

## Hands-On Exercise
- Initialize a Swarm cluster
- Deploy a service to Kubernetes (minikube or cloud)

## Self-Assessment
- Can you describe the difference between Swarm and Kubernetes?
- Did you deploy a service with orchestration?
